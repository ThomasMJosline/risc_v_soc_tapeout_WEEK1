# Day 1 

## I. HDL Design, Simulatior and Testbench

### **1. HDL Design**
HDL design is the description of the hardware logic intended to realize in either a Hardware Description Language such as System Verilog or VHDL.

### **2. Simulatior**
Simulator is the tool used to check the functionality and behaviour of the Hardware implemented through the HDL design. This is done by supplying some set of predescribed inputs into the design and observing the corresponding outputs.

### **3. Testbench**
Testbench is a file that is used to supply a set of input values to the design with whatever timings as we want observe. Testbench file together with the Simulator is used to verify the functionality of the design. In this RISC-V SoC tapeout program, the simulatior used wil be Icarus Verilog, which is an open source simulator.
